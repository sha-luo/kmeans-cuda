# Please follow these intructions so that the autograder     #
# can compile and run your program and check the results.    #
#                                                            #
# For each implementation of kmeans (Sequential, Thrust,     #
# CUDA, Alternatives), you need to specify values to         #
# fields according to the following rules                    #
#                                                            #
# Compilation                                                #
#                                                            #
#   You need to specify how to compile your program and let  #
#   the autograder know the name of the executable. These    #
#   can be done using the following two fields               #
#                                                            #
#     How_To_Compile                                         #
#     Executable                                             #
#                                                            #
#   Note:                                                    #
#     - Your program will be run with -d dims automatically. #
#       Make sure your program accepts -d dims as one of     #
#       the command line arguements to specify the dimention #
#       of the points.                                       #
#     - The provided commands will be run in the top level   #
#       directory of your submission directory. If you       #
#       have sub dirs inside your submission directory,      #
#       make sure the commands work at the top level dir.    #
#     - Make sure to specify a one-line command to compile   #
#       your program. If more than one line is needed, put   #
#       all commands in a Makefile and specify make here.    #
#                                                            #
# Extra Flags                                                #
#                                                            #
#   By defaul, your program will be run with the following   #
#   command line arguments                                   #
#                                                            #
#     -k nClusters -t thrshd -d dims -i iFile -m 200 -s seed #
#                                                            #
#   If your implementation requires additional argument, you #
#   should specifiy the following field                      #
#                                                            #
#     Extra_Args                                             #
#                                                            #
#                                                            #
# Implementation                                             #
#                                                            #
#   Do not delete any field under the section of your        #
#   implementation. However, if you do not have any of       #
#   the following implementations, you should delete         #
#   the whole section corresponding to the unimplemented     #
#   solution.                                                #
#                                                            #

#   Anything after '#' through the rest of the line is       #
#   comment, which is ignored by the autograder.             #
